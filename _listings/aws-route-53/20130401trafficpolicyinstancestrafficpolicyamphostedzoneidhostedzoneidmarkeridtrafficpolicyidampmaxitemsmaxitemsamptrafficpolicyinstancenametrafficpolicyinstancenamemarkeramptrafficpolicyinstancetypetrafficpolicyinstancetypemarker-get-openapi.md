  description: 'Gets information about the traffic policy instances that you created
    by using a specifytraffic policy version.NoteAfter you submit a CreateTrafficPolicyInstance
    or anUpdateTrafficPolicyInstance request, there''s a brief delay while Amazon
    Route 53creates the resource record sets that are specified in the traffic policy
    definition. Formore information, see the State response element.Send a GET request
    to the /Route 53 APIversion/trafficpolicyinstance resource and include the ID
    and version ofthe traffic policy.Amazon Route 53 returns a maximum of 100 items
    in each response. If you have a lot of trafficpolicy instances, you can use the
    MaxItems parameter to list them in groups of upto 100.The response includes five
    values that help you navigate from one group ofMaxItems traffic policy instances
    to the next:             IsTruncated               If the value of IsTruncated
    in the response is true,there are more traffic policy instances associated with
    the specified trafficpolicy.If IsTruncated is false, this response includes the
    lasttraffic policy instance that is associated with the specified traffic policy.             MaxItems               The

    the current response.                  HostedZoneIdMarker, TrafficPolicyInstanceNameMarker,
    and TrafficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker               If IsTruncated is true, these
    values in the responserepresent the first traffic policy instance in the next
    group of MaxItemstraffic policy instances. To list more traffic policy instances,
    make another call toListTrafficPolicyInstancesByPolicy, and specify these values

      description: Creates a new public hosted zone, used to specify how the Domain
        Name System (DNS)routes traffic on the Internet for a domain, such as example.com,
        and its subdomains. ImportantPublic hosted zones can't be converted to a private
        hosted zone or vice versa.Instead, create a new hosted zone with the same
        name and create new resource recordsets.Send a POST request to the /2013-04-01/hostedzone
        resource. The request body must include a documentwith a CreateHostedZoneRequest
        element. The response returns theCreateHostedZoneResponse element containing
        metadata about the hostedzone.Fore more information about charges for hosted
        zones, see Amazon Route 53 Pricing.Note the following:You can't create a hosted
        zone for a top-level domain (TLD).Amazon Route 53 automatically creates a
        default SOA record and four NS records for the zone.For more information about
        SOA and NS records, see NS and SOA Records that Amazon Route 53 Creates for
        a Hosted Zone in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.If your domain is registered
        with a registrar other than Amazon Route 53, you must update thename servers
        with your registrar to make Amazon Route 53 your DNS service. For more information,
        seeConfiguring Amazon Route 53 as your DNSService in the Amazon Route 53 Developer's
        Guide.After creating a zone, its initial status is PENDING. This means that
        itis not yet available on all DNS servers. The status of the zone changes
        to INSYNCwhen the NS and SOA records are available on all Amazon Route 53
        DNS servers. When trying to create a hosted zone using a reusable delegation
        set, specify anoptional DelegationSetId, and Amazon Route 53 would assign
        those 4 NS records for the zone, instead ofallotting a new one.

      summary: Change Resource Record Sets
      description: 'Create, change, update, or delete authoritative DNS information

        Route 53 hosted ZoneID/rrset resource. The request body must include a document
        with aChangeResourceRecordSetsRequest element. The request body contains a
        list ofchange items, known as a change batch. Change batches are considered
        transactional changes.When using the Amazon Route 53 API to change resource
        record sets, Amazon Route 53 either makes all or none of thechanges in a change
        batch request. This ensures that Amazon Route 53 never partially implements
        theintended changes to the resource record sets in a hosted zone. For example,
        a change batch request that deletes the CNAME record forwww.example.com and
        creates an alias resource record set for www.example.com. Amazon Route 53
        deletesthe first resource record set and creates the second resource record
        set in a singleoperation. If either the DELETE or the CREATE action fails,
        thenboth changes (plus any other changes in the batch) fail, and the original
        CNAMErecord continues to exist.ImportantDue to the nature of transactional
        changes, you can''t delete the same resourcerecord set more than once in a
        single change batch. If you attempt to delete the same changebatch more than
        once, Amazon Route 53 returns an InvalidChangeBatch error.NoteTo create resource
        record sets for complex routing configurations, use either thetraffic flow
        visual editor in the Amazon Route 53 console or the API actions for traffic
        policies andtraffic policy instances. Save the configuration as a traffic
        policy, then associate thetraffic policy with one or more domain names (such
        as example.com) or subdomain names (suchas www.example.com), in the same hosted
        zone or in multiple hosted zones. You can roll backthe updates if the new
        configuration isn''t performing as expected. For more information, seeUsing
        Traffic Flow to Route DNSTraffic in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.Use
        ChangeResourceRecordsSetsRequest to perform the following actions:                  CREATE:
        Creates a resource record set that has the specified values.                  DELETE:
        Deletes an existing resource record set that has the specified values.                  UPSERT:
        If a resource record set does not already exist, AWS createsit. If a resource
        set does exist, Amazon Route 53 updates it with the values in the request.
        The values that you need to include in the request depend on the type of resource
        record set that you''re creating, deleting, or updating:            Basic
        resource record sets (excluding alias, failover, geolocation, latency, and
        weighted resource record sets)                           Name                                 Type                                 TTL                           Failover,

        (for failover, geolocation, latency, and weighted resource record sets)When
        you submit a ChangeResourceRecordSets request, Amazon Route 53 propagates
        your changes to all of the Amazon Route 53 authoritative DNS servers. While
        your changes are propagating, GetChange returns a status of PENDING. When
        propagation is complete, GetChange returns a status of INSYNC. Changes generally
        propagate to all Amazon Route 53 name servers in a few minutes. In rare circumstances,
        propagation can take up to 30 minutes. For more information, see GetChange       For
        information about the limits on a ChangeResourceRecordSets request, see Limits

        or anUpdateTrafficPolicyInstance request, there''s a brief delay while Amazon
        Route 53creates the resource record sets that are specified in the traffic
        policy definition. Formore information, see the State response element.Send
        a GET request to the /Route 53 APIversion/trafficpolicyinstance resource and
        include the ID and version ofthe traffic policy.Amazon Route 53 returns a
        maximum of 100 items in each response. If you have a lot of trafficpolicy
        instances, you can use the MaxItems parameter to list them in groups of upto
        100.The response includes five values that help you navigate from one group
        ofMaxItems traffic policy instances to the next:             IsTruncated               If
        the value of IsTruncated in the response is true,there are more traffic policy
        instances associated with the specified trafficpolicy.If IsTruncated is false,
        this response includes the lasttraffic policy instance that is associated
        with the specified traffic policy.             MaxItems               The
        value that you specified for the MaxItems parameter in the requestthat produced
        the current response.                  HostedZoneIdMarker, TrafficPolicyInstanceNameMarker,
        and TrafficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker               If IsTruncated is true,
        these values in the responserepresent the first traffic policy instance in
        the next group of MaxItemstraffic policy instances. To list more traffic policy
        instances, make another call toListTrafficPolicyInstancesByPolicy, and specify
        these values in thecorresponding request parameters.If IsTruncated is false,
        all three elements are omittedfrom the response.'
