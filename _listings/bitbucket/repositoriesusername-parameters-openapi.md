      summary: Get Repositories Username
      description: |-
        Returns a paginated list of all repositories owned by the specified
        account or UUID.

        The result can be narrowed down based on the authenticated user's role.

        E.g. with `?role=contributor`, only those repositories that the
        authenticated user has write access to are returned (this includes any
        repo the user is an admin on, as that implies write access).

        This endpoint also supports filtering and sorting of the results. See
        [filtering and sorting](../../meta/filtering) for more details.
