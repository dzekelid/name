        **This endpoint allows you to delete an IP pool.**

        IP Pools allow you to group your dedicated SendGrid IP addresses together. For example, you could create separate pools for your transactional and marketing email. When sending marketing emails, specify that you want to use the marketing IP pool. This allows you to maintain separate reputations for your different email traffic.

        IP pools can only be used with whitelabeled IP addresses.

        If an IP pool is NOT specified for an email, it will use any IP available, including ones in pools.

      description: |-
        **This endpoint allows you to retrive the monthly email statistics for a specific subuser.**

        While you can always view the statistics for all email activity on your account, subuser statistics enable you to view specific segments of your stats for your subusers. Emails sent, bounces, and spam reports are always tracked for subusers. Unsubscribes, clicks, and opens are tracked if you have enabled the required settings.

        When using the `sort_by_metric` to sort your stats by a specific metric, you can not sort by the following metrics:
        `bounce_drops`, `deferred`, `invalid_emails`, `processed`, `spam_report_drops`, `spam_reports`, or `unsubscribe_drops`.
